# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Sudoku Solver in Rust

## 1. Objective
Develop a command-line Sudoku solver in Rust that efficiently solves standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzles, focusing on correctness, performance, and code clarity.

---

## 2. Features

### 2.1 Input
- Accept Sudoku puzzles via:
  - Standard input (stdin)
  - (Optional, future) File input
- Input format: 9 lines of 9 characters (digits 1-9, 0 or . for empty cells)

### 2.2 Output
- Print the solved Sudoku grid to stdout in a readable format
- If no solution exists, print an appropriate message

### 2.3 Solver
- Implement a backtracking algorithm
- Handle puzzles with a unique solution and detect unsolvable puzzles

### 2.4 Validation
- Validate input format and values
- Check for initial puzzle validity (no rule violations in the starting grid)

### 2.5 Testing
- Unit tests for core logic
- Test cases for valid, invalid, and unsolvable puzzles

---

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- Performance: Solve typical puzzles in under 1 second
- Code Quality: Idiomatic Rust, modular, documented
- CLI Usability: Clear error messages and usage instructions

---

## 4. Out of Scope (v1)
- GUI or web interface
- Puzzles larger than 9x9
- Puzzle generation

---

# Stagewise Implementation Plan

Each stage is unique, testable, and verifiable.

---

## Stage 1: Project Setup & CLI Skeleton
- Initialize Rust project (cargo)
- Implement CLI to accept input from stdin
- Print input grid back to stdout for verification
- **Test:** Input/output roundtrip with sample grid

---

## Stage 2: Input Parsing & Validation
- Parse input into internal grid representation (2D array/vector)
- Validate input format and values
- Check for initial rule violations (rows, columns, boxes)
- **Test:** Unit tests for parsing and validation, including invalid/edge cases

---

## Stage 3: Output Formatting
- Implement pretty-printing of the Sudoku grid
- **Test:** Output matches expected format for various grids

---

## Stage 4: Core Solver Implementation
- Implement backtracking solver
- Integrate with CLI
- **Test:** Unit tests for solver with known puzzles (solvable, unsolvable, multiple solutions)

---

## Stage 5: Error Handling & User Feedback
- Handle and report errors (invalid input, unsolvable puzzle)
- Provide clear CLI messages
- **Test:** CLI outputs correct messages for all error scenarios

---

## Stage 6: Comprehensive Testing & Documentation
- Add more test cases (edge cases, performance)
- Document code and usage
- **Test:** All tests pass, documentation is clear
