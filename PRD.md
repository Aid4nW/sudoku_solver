# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Sudoku Solver in Rust

## 1. Objective
Develop a command-line Sudoku solver in Rust that efficiently solves standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzles, focusing on correctness, performance, and code clarity.

---

## 2. Features

### 2.1 Input
- Accept Sudoku puzzles via:
  - Standard input (stdin)
  - (Optional, future) File input
- Input format: 9 lines of 9 characters (digits 1-9, 0 or . for empty cells)

### 2.2 Output
- Print the solved Sudoku grid to stdout in a readable format
- If no solution exists, print an appropriate message

### 2.3 Solver
- Implement a backtracking algorithm
- Handle puzzles with a unique solution and detect unsolvable puzzles

### 2.4 Validation
- Validate input format and values
- Check for initial puzzle validity (no rule violations in the starting grid)

### 2.5 Testing
- Unit tests for core logic
- Test cases for valid, invalid, and unsolvable puzzles

---

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- Performance: Solve typical puzzles in under 1 second
- Code Quality: Idiomatic Rust, modular, documented
- CLI Usability: Clear error messages and usage instructions

---

## 4. Out of Scope (v1)
- GUI or web interface
- Puzzles larger than 9x9
- Puzzle generation

---

# Stagewise Implementation Plan

Each stage is unique, testable, and verifiable.

---

## Stage 1: Project Setup & CLI Skeleton
- Initialize Rust project (cargo)
- Implement CLI to accept input from stdin
- Print input grid back to stdout for verification
- **Test:** Input/output roundtrip with sample grid

---

## Stage 2: Input Parsing & Validation
- Parse input into internal grid representation (2D array/vector)
- Validate input format and values
- Check for initial rule violations (rows, columns, boxes)
- **Test:** Unit tests for parsing and validation, including invalid/edge cases

---

## Stage 3: Output Formatting
- Implement pretty-printing of the Sudoku grid
- **Test:** Output matches expected format for various grids

---


## Stage 4: Core Solver Implementation (Breakdown)

### 4.1: Grid Data Structure & Utilities
- Define a clear internal representation for the Sudoku grid (already done, but refactor if needed).
- Implement utility functions:
  - Find the next empty cell.
  - Check if a number can be placed at a given position (row, col, box).
**Test:** Unit tests for utility functions (e.g., can_place, find_empty).

### 4.2: Backtracking Solver Function
- Implement the recursive backtracking algorithm using the utilities.
- Return true if solved, false if unsolvable.
**Test:** Unit tests for the solver with:
  - Solvable puzzles (should return true and fill the grid).
  - Unsolvable puzzles (should return false).

### 4.3: CLI Integration
- Integrate the solver into the CLI.
- On valid input, attempt to solve and print the solution (or a message if unsolvable).
**Test:** CLI tests for solving and unsolvable cases.

### 4.4: Multiple Solutions (Optional, for completeness)
- (Optional) Extend the solver to detect if there are multiple solutions.
**Test:** Unit test with a puzzle that has more than one solution.

---

## Stage 5: Error Handling & User Feedback
- Handle and report errors (invalid input, unsolvable puzzle)
- Provide clear CLI messages
- **Test:** CLI outputs correct messages for all error scenarios

---

## Stage 6: Comprehensive Testing & Documentation
- Add more test cases (edge cases, performance)
- Document code and usage
- **Test:** All tests pass, documentation is clear
